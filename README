Per Device Application Volume

small user daemon to automatically change application volume based on default output device

installtion (arch linux): use yay or any other AUR helper of your choice

yay -S aur/pdav

usage:

configure your application volume like you normally would and have the volume saved based on default output device
when changing default output device PDAV will automatically adjust the volume

reasoning:
sometimes i play games over my speakers, sometimes over headphones when also on a voice call
this removes the need to manually adjust this every time
