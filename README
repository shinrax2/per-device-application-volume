Per Device Application Volume

small user daemon to automatically change application volume based on default output device

requirements:

python3
pulsectl
pipewire-pulse OR pulseaudio
systemd (optional, only for the daemon part)

installtion:

git clone https://github.com/shinrax2/per-device-application-volume
cd per-device-application-volume
sed -i 's#/home/shinrax2/GitHub/per-device-application-volume#'`pwd`'#' pdav.service
sudo ln pdav.service /etc/systemd/user/pdav.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user --now enable pdav.service

usage:

configure your application volume like you normally would and have the volume saved based on default output device
when changing default output device PDAV will automatically adjust the volume

reasoning:
sometimes i play games over my speakers, sometimes over headphones when also on a voice call
this removes the need to manually adjust this every time
